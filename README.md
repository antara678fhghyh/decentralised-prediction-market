# Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Description

The Decentralized Prediction Market is a blockchain-based platform that enables users to create, participate in, and resolve prediction markets in a trustless and decentralized manner. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform allows anyone to create markets about future events, place bets on outcomes, and earn rewards based on correct predictions.

The system operates without intermediaries, using smart contracts to manage market creation, bet placement, resolution, and payout distribution. All transactions are transparent, immutable, and executed automatically according to predefined rules.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize prediction markets by creating a fully decentralized, transparent, and accessible platform where anyone can:

- **Create Markets**: Launch prediction markets about any future event
- **Participate Freely**: Place bets on outcomes without geographical restrictions
- **Earn Fairly**: Receive proportional rewards based on accurate predictions
- **Trust the System**: Rely on blockchain technology for transparent and tamper-proof operations

We aim to harness the collective wisdom of crowds to create more accurate predictions about future events while providing a fair and transparent betting environment.
